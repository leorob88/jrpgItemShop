# jrpg Item Shop
How to use:

You can try this at: https://jrpg-item-shop.netlify.app

This is just a shop simulator for a basic JS project. You have a limited amount of money to spend in the shop. Just choose how many items you want to buy, using + and - buttons, then use Buy button. When asked, confirm or cancel. Spent money will be actually spent and you will remain with the left amount. The only way to reset the base money value is to refresh the page.
